# bpp-sqe-assessment-1

This test focusses on automation. We would like you to automate the following action:

- Sign into GitHub (implemented).
- Create a new issue on the repository (not implemented).

The sample code for this repo is [playwright](https://playwright.dev) in Typescript, but you can use any JS-based automation framework/library of your choosing - **except Selenium**.

Points to consider:

- Configuration
- Modularity
- Behaviours
